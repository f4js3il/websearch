                3. Flag potential discrepancies or red flags (e.g., business description mismatch, high-risk operations not declared, multiple business lines, unclear or conflicting info).
                4. Search for and summarize relevant online reviews or public reputation insights.
                5. Identify if the business operates in or lists additional states beyond the main address.
